Public nudity laws vary significantly between countries, states, and even local jurisdictions. Here are detailed examples from various regions to illustrate these differences:

### United States
Public nudity laws in the U.S. vary widely by state and city.

1. **California**:
   - **Law**: California Penal Code 314 prohibits willful and lewd exposure of private parts in public.
   - **Example**: A person sunbathing nude on a beach that is not designated as clothing-optional could be arrested and charged with a misdemeanor.

2. **New York City**:
   - **Law**: Public nudity is illegal under New York Penal Law 245.01, but there is an exception for women, who are allowed to be topless in public wherever men are allowed to be topless.
   - **Example**: A woman can legally sunbathe topless in Central Park, but complete nudity would be illegal.

3. **San Francisco**:
   - **Law**: San Francisco has specific ordinances that prohibit public nudity except during permitted events, such as the Folsom Street Fair.
   - **Example**: Participating nude in the Folsom Street Fair with proper permits is legal, but walking naked in the city on any other day could result in a fine.

### Europe

1. **Germany**:
   - **Law**: Germany has a generally tolerant attitude towards public nudity, especially in designated areas known as "Freikörperkultur" (FKK) zones.
   - **Example**: It is legal to be nude in many public parks and beaches that are designated as FKK areas. However, being nude outside these areas, like in a city center, could lead to fines.

2. **United Kingdom**:
   - **Law**: Public nudity is not illegal per se, but under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, it becomes an offense if it is intended to cause harassment, alarm, or distress.
   - **Example**: Nudity at a designated naturist beach is legal. Walking naked through a residential area with the intent to shock or offend someone could result in a charge of causing public nuisance.

3. **Spain**:
   - **Law**: Spain has no national laws against public nudity, but local municipalities can enforce their own regulations.
   - **Example**: In Barcelona, public nudity was banned in 2011, so a person walking nude through the streets of Barcelona could be fined. However, being nude on designated nudist beaches, such as those in Ibiza, is legal.

### Australia
Public nudity laws in Australia also vary by state and territory.

1. **New South Wales**:
   - **Law**: Public nudity is generally illegal unless in a designated nude bathing area.
   - **Example**: Nudity at designated nude beaches such as Lady Bay Beach is legal, but being nude at Bondi Beach, which is not a nude beach, would result in a fine.

2. **Victoria**:
   - **Law**: The Summary Offences Act 1966 makes it an offense to willfully expose one’s genitals in public.
   - **Example**: Nudity at clothing-optional beaches such as Sunnyside North Beach is permitted. However, being nude in a public park would likely result in a fine.

### Canada
Canada's approach to public nudity also varies by province and context.

1. **Ontario**:
   - **Law**: Public nudity is addressed under the Criminal Code, which prohibits indecent acts in public places.
   - **Example**: Being nude on a designated nudist beach, like Hanlan's Point Beach in Toronto, is legal. However, walking nude through downtown Toronto would be considered an indecent act and could result in arrest.

2. **British Columbia**:
   - **Law**: Public nudity is generally prohibited, but certain areas are known to tolerate it.
   - **Example**: Wreck Beach in Vancouver is a well-known clothing-optional beach where nudity is accepted. Nudity outside such designated areas could lead to charges of public indecency.

These examples illustrate how the legality of public nudity depends on specific locations and contexts within each region. It is essential for individuals to be aware of local laws and regulations to avoid legal issues.
